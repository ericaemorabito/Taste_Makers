# Taste_Makers
  I created this recipe finder app with a team of web developers learning in the UT Austin Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

## Motivation

- This project helped me understand fetching information from a third-party API.
- This project also taught me how to use local storage.

## Description

  Users can choose between four options for cuisine and desert, view a list of recipes, and a video tutorial, and then save their favorite recipes to favorites.

## Usage
Visit our [Tastemakers website](https://ericaemorabito.github.io/Taste_Makers/).
